# Now

What I am actively working on or studying right now.

## Build / Project Focus

- [FinMAs](https://github.com/KevorkSulahian/agentic-llm-for-better-results): improving the agent flow and gradually adding more capabilities (including vision ideas).
- LLM evaluation reliability: judge robustness, reward hacking, and answer-matching failure modes.
- Converting more experiments into cleaner, shareable mini-projects with documentation.

## Fun short sized activites

- [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/courses) for consistency and interview prep
- [Deep-ML exercises](https://www.deep-ml.com/) for practical ML problem solving
- [Nandgame](https://nandgame.com/) for systems intuition
- [CMU puzzles](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/puzzle/) for problem-solving reps
- [Open problems / project ideas in evals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gi32-HZozxVimNg5Mhvk4CvW4zq8J12rGmK_j2zxNEg/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.q14pjbvzx1x)
- [Implementing paper](https://papercode.vercel.app/)

## Ongoing Habit

- Document the work, not just the outcome (code + short write-up + what changed)
