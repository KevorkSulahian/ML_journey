It is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing. Look what happened. Is this crazy? I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected. You're 47th president and you're 45th president. I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe, and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve. This will truly be the golden age of America. That's what we have to do. I think that we just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America. And after the greatest political comeback in American history, we're going to lead the greatest economic comeback in American history under Donald Trump's leadership. We're going to have to seal up those borders and we're going to have to let people come into our country. We have to let them come back in, but they have to come in legally. A star is born, Elon. These characters are special, guys. They're super genius. We have to protect our geniuses. We don't have that many of them. This is karma, ladies and gentlemen. He deserves this. They deserve it as a family. I want to thank the Nell boys, Aiden Ross, Theo Vaughn. Bustle with the boys. And last but not least, the mighty and powerful Joe Rogan. We could add a few names like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He wants to do some things and we're going to let him go to it. I just said, but Bobby, leave the oil to me. We have more liquid gold, oil and gas. We have more liquid gold than any country in the world, more than Saudi Arabia. We have more than Russia. Bobby, stay away from the liquid gold. Other than that, go have a good time, Bobby. Yesterday, as I stood at my last stop on the campaign trail, I'll never be doing a rally again. Can you believe it? Many people have told me that God spared my life for a reason. And that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness. And now we are going to fulfill that mission together. We're going to fulfill that mission. It's time to put the divisions of the past four years behind us. It's time to unite. And we're going to try. We're going to try. We have to try. And it's going to happen. Success will bring us together. I've seen that. So I want to just tell you what a great honor this is. I want to thank you. I will not let you down. America's future will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than it has ever been before. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.
