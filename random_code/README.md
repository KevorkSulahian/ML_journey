# `random_code` Index (Experiment Lab)

`random_code/` is the main experimentation workspace in this repository.
The name is legacy, but this folder contains most of the practical ML/LLM, app, and tooling work.

## How to Browse This Folder

- If you want runnable mini-projects, start with the folders that include their own `README.md`.
- If you want learning notebooks, browse by topic/category below.
- If you want portfolio highlights, start with `aws/answer-matcher-gaming`, `neofetch`, `news_hub`, and the FastAPI/Docker folders.

## Portfolio Highlights

- [`aws/answer-matcher-gaming/`](./aws/answer-matcher-gaming/): LLM answer-matching judge gaming / eval harness
- [`neofetch/`](./neofetch/): Python neofetch clone with `rich`
- [`news_hub/`](./news_hub/): Flask-style web app structure (`app.py`, templates, static)
- [`docker/fastapi/`](./docker/fastapi/): Dockerized FastAPI experiments
- [`lang_chain/`](./lang_chain/): LangChain project scaffold

## Agents / Orchestration

- [`crewai/`](./crewai/): multiple CrewAI experiments (AI news, video analysis, meeting minutes, FastAPI crew)
- [`langgraph/`](./langgraph/): LangGraph experiments (including agent work)
- [`mcp/`](./mcp/): MCP toy projects / calculators
- [`a2a-samples/`](./a2a-samples/): agent-to-agent samples

## Notes

- Some folders are scratchpads, so dependencies/env setup may be incomplete.
- Over time, the goal is to promote the strongest work from this folder into more polished, documented project directories.
