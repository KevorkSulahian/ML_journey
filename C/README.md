# C Learning Track

This folder tracks my C programming practice (mainly from CC4E/K&R-style exercises) plus a few small projects.

## What Is Here

- `chapter_1` to `chapter_7`: exercises and small programs while learning C fundamentals
- `first_project`: an early standalone C project
- `function_testing`: small function/header split practice

## Why It Matters (Portfolio Context)

- Improves systems intuition (memory, pointers, low-level debugging)
- Helps me write and reason about code more carefully
- Supports stronger ML engineering fundamentals beyond notebooks

## Notes

- Some compiled binaries / build artifacts are kept here from learning runs.
- This folder is mostly about progression and reps, not polished production code.
